## What is Advent of Code?

From the Advent of Code website:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets 
> and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
> People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, 
> practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
